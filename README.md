# 🛠️ Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repo — a curated collection of configs I use to keep my environment smooth, fast, and consistent across machines.

## 📦 What’s included

- `.vimrc` — My Vim setup with tab, buffer, and leader key mappings.
- `setup.sh` — Script to symlink everything into the home directory.
- Future additions: `.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, etc.

## 🚀 Setup

Clone and run the setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./setup.sh
